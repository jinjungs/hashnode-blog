## ‚úçÔ∏è **Why I wrote this**

I created my Hashnode blog about six months ago and recently started posting again.

In the past, I used GitHub Pages with [github.io](https://jinjungs.github.io/) for blogging ‚Äî which meant maintaining a GitHub repo, writing or updating `.md` files manually, then committing and pushing them. It was a bit tedious, but I liked that it helped me track both blog posts and GitHub activity at the same time.

That made me wonder: **Is there a way to commit to GitHub automatically when publishing on Hashnode?** Turns out ‚Äî yes, there is!

This post is a walkthrough of how I set up **GitHub Actions to automatically back up my Hashnode blog**, organize posts into folders, and rename those unreadable `.md` filenames.

---

## üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **What I want**

1. Automatically commit to GitHub whenever I publish a Hashnode post
    
2. Organize posts into folders by series/topic
    
3. Rename .md files to readable filenames instead of UUIDs
    

---

## **‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äì Connect Hashnode to GitHub**

### **1.1. Create a GitHub Repository**

Create a new GitHub repository that will store your backed-up Hashnode posts.  
It can be public or private ‚Äî but I recommend public if you‚Äôre using it as a writing portfolio.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749154245768/8946829b-0a91-4e9f-ba28-35272eaff2be.png align="center")

### **1.2. Enable GitHub Integration in Hashnode**

Go to:  
Hashnode Dashboard ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí GitHub Integration ‚Üí Install Hashnode App ‚Üí Install & Authorize

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not select ‚ÄúAll repositories.‚Äù  
> Choose only the specific repository you created for this sync.

After install & authorizing, you will see the drafts, articles and the status of backed up.  
Click ‚ÄúBack up all articles‚Äù to backup.

**Congratulation!** üéâ  
**You have Successfully sync your Hashnode with Github!**

Once installed and configured, your published posts will be backed up as `.md` files to your GitHub repository.

---

## **‚úÖ Step 2 ‚Äì Auto-Organize with GitHub Actions**

I wanted to automatically organize my posts into folders based on topic, like this:

```plaintext
hashnode-blog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python-basics/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ print-formatting.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-test/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sorting-algorithms-1.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ essential-libraries.md
```

### **2.1. Check GitHub Action Permissions**

Go to:  
Github project (you made in Step 1) Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow permissions ‚Üí Make sure Read and write permissions are enabled.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Without this, you‚Äôll get an error like:

```yaml
remote: Permission to [your-repo].git denied to github-actions[bot]
fatal: unable to access [...]: 403
```

### **2.2. GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a file at:  
.github/workflows/organize-posts.yml

```yaml
name: Organize Blog Posts by Slug

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "*.md"

jobs:
  organize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install Python YAML parser
        run: pip install pyyaml

      - name: Organize files into series folders
        run: |
          import os, yaml, shutil
          for filename in os.listdir("."):
              if filename.endswith(".md"):
                  with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                      lines = f.readlines()
                  if lines[0].strip() == "---":
                      frontmatter = []
                      for line in lines[1:]:
                          if line.strip() == "---":
                              break
                          frontmatter.append(line)
                      meta = yaml.safe_load("".join(frontmatter))
                      series = meta.get("series")
                      if series:
                          os.makedirs(series, exist_ok=True)
                          dest = os.path.join(series, filename)
                          shutil.move(filename, dest)

        shell: python

      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "github-actions@github.com"
          git add .
          git commit -m "Organized posts by series" || echo "No changes to commit"
          git pull --rebase origin main
          git push
```

You can check in the ‚ÄúActions Tab‚Äù to see the action is properly registered. Once the workflow is added, you‚Äôll see it running in the **Actions tab** whenever you push `.md` files to the repo.

### **2.3. Testing the Workflow**

To test it, I restored a deleted post and triggered a new backup.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749101775110/bbc12d51-75d0-4174-b45f-0ccadab1676a.png align="center")

Then I checked if the workflow succeeded and if the posts were organized into folders.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749101924008/b1d7f33d-0a21-4c03-b856-addff8121b1e.png align="center")

**Everything worked!** üéâ  
The file is now categorized automatically when you publish a new post.

---

## **‚úÖ Step 3 ‚Äì Renaming Files to Slug**

But there‚Äôs one problem left. By default, Hashnode backups use a random UID for filenames. This makes it hard to manage or find specific posts.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749101994165/dafbd150-0871-48bb-9b03-7382e64cb4f5.png align="center")

To fix that, let‚Äôs change the workflow to rename the files based on the post‚Äôs slug.

```python
slug = meta.get("slug", "")
new_filename = f"{slug}.md"
os.rename(filename, new_filename)
```

Here‚Äôs the complete updated YAML file with file renaming and folder categorization logic.

```yaml
name: Organize Blog Posts by Slug

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "*.md"
  
jobs:
  organize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install PyYAML
        run: pip install pyyaml

      - name: Organize by slug keyword
        run: |
          import os, yaml, shutil

          SLUG_KEYWORDS = {
              "coding-test": "coding-test",
              "python-basics": "python-basics"
          }

          for filename in os.listdir("."):
              if filename.endswith(".md"):
                  with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                      lines = f.readlines()

                  if lines[0].strip() == "---":
                      frontmatter = []
                      for line in lines[1:]:
                          if line.strip() == "---":
                              break
                          frontmatter.append(line)

                      meta = yaml.safe_load("".join(frontmatter))
                      slug = meta.get("slug", "")

                      # rename file to slug
                      new_filename = f"{slug}.md"
                      os.rename(filename, new_filename)

                      # Then, use new_filename from this point forward
                      matched = False
                      for keyword, folder in SLUG_KEYWORDS.items():
                          if keyword in slug:
                              os.makedirs(folder, exist_ok=True)
                              shutil.move(new_filename, os.path.join(folder, new_filename))  # ‚Üê updated here
                              matched = True
                              print(f"Moved {new_filename} to {folder}/")
                              break

                      if not matched:
                          print(f"No matching slug keyword found for: {new_filename}")
        shell: python

      - name: Commit organized files
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "github-actions@github.com"
          git add .
          git commit -m "Organized posts by slug keywords" || echo "No changes"
          git pull --rebase origin main
          git push
```

I synced again in Hashnode and then checked if it was successful.

**Sync complete!** üéâ  
Your blog posts are now cleanly organized and version-controlled.
