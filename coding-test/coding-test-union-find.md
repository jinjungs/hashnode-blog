Union-Find, also known asÂ **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**, is a data structure that efficiently keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It's particularly useful in problems involvingÂ **connectivity**, such as determining whether two elements are in the same group or detecting cycles in a graph.

---

## âœ¨ Summary

* **Purpose**: Track and manage disjoint sets
    
* **Core operations**:
    
    * `find(x)`: Find the representative (root) of the set containingÂ `x`
        
    * `union(x, y)`: Merge the sets that containÂ `x`Â andÂ `y`
        
* **Optimizations**: Path compression and union by rank/size
    
* **Time Complexity**: Nearly O(1) per operation with optimizations

## ðŸ§± Basic Implementation

```python
def find(x):
    if parent[x] != x:
        parent[x] = find(parent[x])  # Path compression
    return parent[x]

def union(x, y):
    rootX = find(x)
    rootY = find(y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        parent[rootY] = rootX  # Union
```

Initialization:

```python
parent = [i for i in range(n)]
```

Each element is its own parent initially.

---

## âš¡ Optimizations

### Path Compression

* DuringÂ `find(x)`, we recursively set the parent of each node to its root.
    
* This flattens the tree, making future operations faster.
    

### Union by Rank or Size (Optional)

* Attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree.
    
* Prevents tree from becoming tall.
    

```python
rank = [1] * n

def union(x, y):
    rootX = find(x)
    rootY = find(y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            if rank[rootX] == rank[rootY]:
                rank[rootX] += 1
```

| Problem Type | Example Problems |
| --- | --- |
| Connectivity / Components | Number of Provinces (LC 547) |
| Cycle Detection | Redundant Connection (LC 684) |

## ðŸ“Œ Example: Number of Provinces (LC 547)

Given an adjacency matrixÂ `isConnected`, count how many connected components (provinces) exist.

```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)
        parent = [i for i in range(n)]

        def find(x):
            if x != parent[x]:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])  # Path compression
            return parent[x]

        def union(x, y):
            rootX = find(x)
            rootY = find(y)
            if rootX != rootY:
                parent[rootY] = rootX

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if isConnected[i][j]:
                    union(i, j)

        return len(set(find(i) for i in range(n)))
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tip

* The problem involvesÂ **grouping**,Â **connected components**, orÂ **merging sets**.
    
* You need to answer: "Are these two elements in the same group?"

## âœ¨ Conclusion

Union-Find is a must-know data structure for any coding interview. With its powerful optimizations and simple API (`find`Â andÂ `union`), it can solve many seemingly complex problems involving relationships, grouping, and connectivity.
